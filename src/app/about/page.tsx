              Hi! I&apos;m Moe, a software engineer passionate about product design. I build user-friendly applications using React, Node.js, and DevOps tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Over five years, I&apos;ve designed solutions for fintech, healthcare, and education sectors, always balancing functionality with thoughtful user experience. Outside of coding, I enjoy films with my dog Puff â€” we both loved &quot;Flow&quot; recently! Open to discussing new opportunities that combine technology with thoughtful design.
